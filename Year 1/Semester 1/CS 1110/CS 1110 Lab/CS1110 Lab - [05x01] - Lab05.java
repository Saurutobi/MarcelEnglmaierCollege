// Program: <Lab 05> File: <Lab05.java; Rocketship.java>
//
// Problem: <The program's purpose is to simulate the interaction between a robot selling spaceships and the human buying the spaceship.>
//
// Programmer(s): <Marcel Englmaier>
// Course: CS1110 <Fall 2011> <M/W 4:30-5:45>
// Lab: <M 12:30-2:20>

// Problem Requirement Analysis (Step 1 - What?) 
//
// Ref.: <List short references to algorithms, program segments, etc.>
// Revision History:
// Released: <10/23/11> <ME>
// Reason: due date
// <10/10/11, Marcel Englmaier, Documentation, lab requirements, code outline with important code commented due to incompletion, began project>
// <10/20/11, Marcel Englmaier, Documentation, lab requirements, completed everything but found a loop issue with the booleans>
// <10/23/11, Marcel Englmaier, Documentation, lab requirements, finished program, fixed loop issue by switching from booleans to integers>

// Input:   <string, keyboard input for rocketship name>
//          <int, keyboard input for rocketship number of engines>
//          <int, keyboard input for rocketship number of shields>
//          <int, keyboard input for rocketship number of weapons>
// Output:  <string, gives summary of transaction>
//          <double, the cost of the rocketship>
//          <rocketship properties, outputted to summarize transaction

// Functions, Methods, Operations, Tasks: 
// <if fuction to test for answer>
// <while loop to sell rocketship>
// <if, switch case, and while functions to test if user input is correct and to assign values to variables>
// <if function to determine cost>
// <switch case function to assign protocol droids>
// <if function to test for answer to repeat while loop>

// Problem Design â€“ Quick Algorithm (Step 2 - How?) 
// 
// 1. <program makes variables to use>
// 2. <interactions between the 'robot' and the user to choose rocketship properties>
// 3. <program makes a rocketship according to properties>
// 4. <outputs results of transactions>
