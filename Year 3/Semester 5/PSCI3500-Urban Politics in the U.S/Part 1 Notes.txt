Political machine:
A political machine is a party organization that depends crucially

	-White anglo saxon protestants were "evicted"
		-normally highly educated
		-Elite politics being displaced by voting
	-Catholics swarmed in
	-early machines introduced the "professional polititian"
What do these machines offer: personal assistance
	-it got you on your feet, but couldn't do more
	-worked on an individual basis
