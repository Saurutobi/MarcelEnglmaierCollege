You are going to create, install and use a File System Mini (or regular) Filter Driver in the kernel of your W-7 Virtual machine (unless you want to do it in a real W-7).

The purpose of this driver is to intercept I/O to any file named “dos.txt”.  It will convert the DOS end of line characters to the Linux end of line and the Dos EOF to the Linux EOF.
Vice Versa, it will intercept I/O to any file named “linux.txt”  and convert the Linux end of line char to the DOS end of line characters as well as the EOF.

Make dos.txt and linux.txt with their respective characters.
Make the driver.
Install the driver.
use right-click copy to copy both original files and paste them somewhere else(this uses your driver).
rename the two resulting files per #7/#8

Turn in a .zip file with:
1.	The install file for the driver(.inf).
2.	The source code for your driver.
3.	A copy of the original dos.txt file.
4.	A copy of the original linux.txt file.
5.	Screen shot of the dos.txt file opened in notepad and wordpad and notepad++ with wrong end of line characters and EOF.
6.	Screen shot of the linux.txt file opened in notepad and wordpad and notepad++ with wrong end of line characters and EOF.
7.	Copy of the file created using right-click copy of dos.txt to another file renamed to "copy of dos.txt".
8.	Copy of the file created using right-click copy of linux.txt to another file renamed to "copy of linux.txt".
