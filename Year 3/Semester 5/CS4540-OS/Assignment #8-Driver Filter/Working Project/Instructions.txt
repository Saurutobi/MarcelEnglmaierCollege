Included:
the inf, the .sys, and the user program
2 images(pre and post driverinstall with notepad)
the source
the original dos.txt file
the dos.txt from after renamed to copyofdos.txt

to run:
install the .inf
run cmd as admin. type: sc start scanner
run another cmd as admin, using cmd, run scanuser.exe(this must be running). if it doesn't say "ERROR blablablabla" then good. don't close
open dos.txt. save it. tada!

Note: the EOF was not replaced due to this being tested on my machine, and I really didn't want to break anything.
	But, as proof I can do it, it would be another "if" statement in the 'for' loop checking for the DOS EOF character,
	and swapping it to linux EOF instead of making it a space. I did it once, but broke a bunch of stuff, and didn't dare do it again.
