Confidence Intervals </center></h3><hr>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Determine the necessary sample size to estimate the populaton mean within 4 units,
with confidence 95\%.   For your determination, make use of the following
sample of data (a pilot study):
<pre>
92  69  88  80  98  98  58  81  20  84  74 114
</pre>
<pre>



</pre>
<li> Source (copy and paste into the R session) the following function. It returns a table containing two columns:
column one contains the confidence percentages 80, 85, 90, 95, 99 and column 2 contains the sample
size determinations for estimating the mean mu.   Input consists of the bound B (within B) and a sigma from a pilot study.
Run it for the last problem and verify, for confidence 95%, that it produces the same n as you got.
<pre>    
         ssd <- function(vecpct=c(80, 85, 90, 95, 99),B,sig){
    
             ss <- c()
             m <- length(vecpct)
             for(i in 1:m){
                 alp2 <- (1-(vecpct[i]/100))/2
                 zc <- abs(qnorm(alp2))
                 ss[i] <- (zc*sig/B)^2 
             }
             mat <- cbind(vecpct,round(ss))
             return(mat)
         }
     
</pre>
<pre>



</pre>
<li>  Determine the necessary sample size to estimate the populaton proportion within .08,
with confidence 95%, using the conservative rule.
<pre>



</pre>
<li> Write a function which returns a table containing two columns:
column one contains the confidence percentages 80, 85, 90, 95, 99 and column 2 contains the corresponding
sample
size determinations  for estimating the population proportion within B, using the conservative rule.
Input is the vector of percentages and B.
Verify the program for the last problem.
<pre>






</pre>

<li> A store stocks 5 brands on an item including Brand A.
The table below consists of the poll results on the purchases of  item A and not A before and
after an intensive marketing campaign on Brand A.
Has the campaign been effective.   Answer based on a 95% confidence interval.
<pre>

         Bought Brand A    Bought another brand
Before         28                82
After          45                93






</pre>

<li> Let mu1 be the maximum head breadth for an ancient Etruscan and
let mu2 be the maximum head breadth for a modern Italian.
Using the class data (look <a href="http://fisher.stat.wmich.edu/joe/Stat5660/Data/"> here </a>)
obtain a 99% confidence interval for mu1 - mu2.
On the basis of this CI make a conclusion in terms of the problem.
