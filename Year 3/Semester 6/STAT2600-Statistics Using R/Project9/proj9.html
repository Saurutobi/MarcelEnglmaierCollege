Stat 2600 Project 9 Due: March R2018, 2014 <br>
Confidence Intervals </center></h3><hr>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Let the R vector <i>x</i> contain the the sample X_1, .... , X_n.
Write an R function (call it twilci.R) which obtains 
<p>
<ul>
<li> the estimate of the mean and the t-confidence interval using the R function t.test
<li> the estimate of the mean and the confidence interval based on the Wilcoxon (Hoges-Lehmann) using the R function wilcox.test
</ul>
For input besides the vector of observations  <i>x</i> input conf.int=TRUE.
<p>
For example, these lines of code obtains the estimate and CI for the Wilcoxon:
<p>
<pre>
          fitwil <- wilcox.test(x,conf.int=T)
          estci <- c(fitwil$est,fitwil$conf.int)
</pre>
So in your function, add the lines of code for the t-confidence interval and then rbind the results together and return the matrix.

<li> Run your function  on the Darwin data.    In an experiment, Darwin took 15 pots.   In each pot, he planted
a cross-fertilized seed and a self-fertilized seed.
Hence, a paired design.
At the end of the study period, he recorded the heights of both plants.
Just form the differences in heights, Cross-Self.   Then obtain the results via your function twilci.R.
Conclude for both analyses (one sentence each) in terms of the data.
Then comment on any differences in the results.
<p>
The data is:
<p>
<pre>
Cross    Self
23.500  17.375
12.000  20.375
21.000  20.000
22.000  20.000
19.125  18.375
21.550  18.625
22.125  18.625
20.375  15.250
18.250  16.500
21.625  18.000
23.250  16.250
21.000  18.000
22.125  12.750
23.000  15.500
12.000  18.000
</pre>
<li>   Edit your function (call it twilci2.R), so that for each analysis it returns the correct sentence from the choices:
<pre>
ans <- "The confidence interval contains 0, so the result is inconclusive"
ans <- "The confidence interval does not contain 0, and at this conf. the mean of X is positive"
ans <- "The confidence interval does not contain 0, and at this conf. the mean of X is negative"
</pre>
Report the results for each of the samples (these are for debugging):
<pre>
sample1:  83 74 18 39 58 44 45 74 93 63
sample2:   -83 -74 -18 -39  58  44  45  74  93  63
sample3:  -83 -74 -18 -39 -58 -44 -45 -74 -93 -63
</pre>
<li>  For the Darwin data change the last row to 12 and 81 (slight typo).
Run this through your function twilci.R and twilci2.R and report the results.
Comment on differences.
