cscan in: simple, just needs file path. do same with italian. make sure some new lines are at the end
1.
hist(x,prob=t)
lines(density(x))

2.
c1<-c(fivenum(x),mean(x),sd(x))
c1

3.
I DON'T KNOW THIS

4.
copypaste function

5.
fences <- function(x){
	#returns lower and upper fences for a vector of data x
	fn <- fivenum(x)
	q1 <- fn[2]
	q3 <- fn[4]
	iq <- q3 - q1
	lower <- q1 - 1.5*iq
	upper <- q3 - 1.5*iq
	return(c(lower,upper))
}

6. Answer the question, and why
