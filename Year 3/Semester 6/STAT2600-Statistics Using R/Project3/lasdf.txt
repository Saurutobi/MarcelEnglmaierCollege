problem 1
take out last fuckin' line



problem 2

r1<-scan()
then enter a line
r2<-scan()
then enter a line
for all lines in file


mat <- rbind(r1,r2,r3) etc


chisq.test(mat)

ruleind <- function(mat)
{
numr <- dim(mat)[1]
numc <- dim(mat)[2]
df <- (numr-1)*(numc-1)
ruleind <- df + 2*sqrt(2*df)
return(ruleind)
}

see <-chisq.test(mat)
see

ruleind(mat)

THIS DOES x=2 y=1 I think
apply(mat,1,sum)
px2 <- 68/sum(mat)
px2 now contains probability
FUCK THIS, DO IT MANUALLY
put in number at x=3 y=4, then divide by sum(mat) like
px3y4 <- 5/sum(mat)
px3y4 now has it


apply(mat,2,sum)
sums all columns

pix3y4 <- the row/sum(mat)
find pix3
piy4
then pix3*piy4=independence prob
but IDK if that's right, look it up on the internet
