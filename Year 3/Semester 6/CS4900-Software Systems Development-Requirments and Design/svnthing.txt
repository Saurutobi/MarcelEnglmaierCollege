A indicates Subversion has added a file to your working
copy in order to bring it up-to-date with a new file in the
repository.
• U shows a file that was out-of-date in your working copy
because a newer version was checked into the repository.
Subversion has updated your working copy of the file to
the new version.
• D indicates that Subversion has removed a file from your
working copy because the file has been deleted from the
repository.
• G shows a file that was out-of-date in your working copy,
which you had modified locally. Subversion successfully
merged the changes from the repository with your local
modifications.
• C shows a file that was out-of-date in your working copy,
which you had also modified locally. Subversion tried to
merge the changes from the repository with your local
modifications but encountered a conflict. You’ll need to
resolve the conflict before you can check in.
