			Note: The "$" refers to the command's prompt. Don't type in the $ when you copy these commands. Also, you must be logged in as root to do most of these commands.
			
			<h3>Changing your password(for root or for a user)</h3>
			#First thing to do is Change your password. Do this with<br>
			$ passwd<br><br>
			
			<h3>Adding a user</h3>
			#Type<br>
			$ useradd <username><br>
			#<username> is the name of the user you'd like to create<br>
			#Now you need to activate it by setting a passwd. Do this with<br>
			$ passwd <username><br>
			#You can also use this command to change other users' passwords from root<br><br>
			
			<h3>Creating a group and adding users to it</h3>
			#Use this to create a group with the name <groupname><br>
			$ groupadd <groupname><br>
			#Now add a user to that group<br>
			$ usermod -a -G <groupname> <username><br><br>
			
			<h3>Adding a user to the sudoers list</h3>
			#Find and open the sudoers file in <br>
			/etc/sudoers<br>
			#At the very bottom, add this line:<br>
			<username>	ALL=(ALL)	ALL<br>
			#This will give <username> the permission to use the sudo command with their personal password.<br><br>
			
			<h3>ssh</h3>
			ssh requires two things: a public key and a private key. These are made on seperate machines. The public key
			is made on the server machine, while the private key is made on the connecting machine. The public key must be
			on the connecting key, and the private key must be on the server machines(this requires simply copying and pasting
			the files into the /.ssh/authorized_keys file.<br>
			When using pretty much any modern machine, this is done automatically and usually prompts the user for a logon password.
			To do this without passwords, both machines need each others keys<br><br>
			
			<h3>Disable Root Logins</h3>
			#Open the sshd config file located here:<br>
			/etc/ssh/sshd_config<br>
			#Make sure you have the following entry<br>
			PermitRootLogin no<br>
			#Now restart the sshd service with<br>
			$ service sshd restart<br><br>
