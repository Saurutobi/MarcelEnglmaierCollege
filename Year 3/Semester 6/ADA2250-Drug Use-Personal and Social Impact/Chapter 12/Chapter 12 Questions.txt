1. The main difference between OTC drugs and dietary supplements is that the first is used to alter functioning in some way desired by the user and that the later provides nutrients.
2. GRAS and GRAE stand for "generally recognized as safe" and "generally recognized as effective", respectively.
3. A drug is permitted to be OTC unless, because of potential toxicity or for other reasons(injection), it may be safely sold and used only under a prescription.
4. The only active ingredient permitted in OTC stimulants is caffeine.
5. On the subject of safety and effectiveness of OTC weight-loss drugs according to the FDA, the book doesn't give a solid answer. It does, however, give examples of drugs that are not safe, and one, Orlistat, that should be used with 'extreme' care. This leads me to think that the FDA is still making up its mind but is leaning towards not-so-safe-and-effective.
6. Nytol, Sleep-Eze, and Sominex are al brand-name OTC drugs containing diphenhydramine.
7. The anticoagulant effects of Aspirin seem to be at the root of Aspririn's ability to help prevent TIAs and Heart Attacks in men.
8. Once again, the book does not give good examples of the differences in therapeutic effects in Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen. I thing the the difference is that Acetaminophen has more 'pain relief' with less disadvantages, while Ibuprofen is a more potent Aspirin and has many more side effects.
9. The most common way for a person to get the cold is to get the virus on their fingers and then rub their eyes or nose.
10. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine which will relieve aches, pains, and reduce fever while phenylaphrine is used to de-congest the nose.
