1. Paraldehyde is the foul-smelling drug that was widely using in mental hospitals before the 1950s.
2. Since a high dose of a fast-acting barbiturate causes quick drowsiness, about 8 hours of sleep, and then no drowsiness, I believe a low dose of Phenobarbital would have a long time of onset, and then cause tiredness or drowsiness. Based on this, I believe Phenobarbital could be used to suppress hyper-activity or anxiety.
3. The faster the drug kicks in, the higher the psychological dependence.
4. It seems that bariturates and benzodiazepines act on the GABA neurotransmitter receptors.
5. Sleeping agents should only be prescribed for a few nights because chronic use is ineffective at best and can be dtrimental to sound sleep.
6. Zolpidem is a hypnotic agent.
7. Characteristics of sedative-hypnotic withdrawal syndrome include anxiety, insomnia, weakness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms often last longer than narcotic withdrawal, and on the second or third day include seizures followed by psychosis. These are more extreme cases of barbiturate withdrawal. Newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics seem to have less chance of severe withdrawal
8. Normal symptoms of overdose include alcohol-like intoxication behavior, followed by ceasing of respiration. If mixed with alcohol, these symptoms set on much quicker.
9. The book did a very poor job of describing solvent effects, but I believe the difference between them and nitrites is that nitrites open the blood vessels causing a feeling of warmth, and in higher doses produce light-headedness, while solvents produce more of a high mixed with light-headedness.
10. A combination of GHB and alcohol produces similar affects to that of combining alcohol and other depressants.
