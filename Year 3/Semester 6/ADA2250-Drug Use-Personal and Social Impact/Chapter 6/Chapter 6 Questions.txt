1. In my opinion, Coca use peaked in popularity just before the 16th-century invasion by Pizarro of the Incas, and around the last half of the 19th century and the first quarter of the 10th century. I would say, because Coca was used as a primary bartering currency during the time of the Incas prior to Pizarro's invasion, that that was when it was most popular.
2. Mariani, Freud, and Halsted popularized cocaine in their own ways. Mariani put it in wine which made him rich. Halsted used it as a local anaesthetic, for which it is very good for, while Freud emphasized its use to treat ailments such as morphine dependence.
3. Coca paste, freebase, crack, and ice are all similar because each can be inhaled.
4. Both cocaine and amphetamines are similar in toxicity as both cause paranoia. Where they differ is that cocaine also causes restlessness and halucinations while amphetamines cause a "crash".
5. If both cocain and amphetamine were placed on schedule 1, it would not be possible for any medical practice to use either.
6. It is believed that the chemical difference bwtween methamphetamine and amphetamine, the extra methyl group, allows methamphetamine to cross the blood-brain barrier more readily, and increases its potency.
7. I think the dependence potential of amphetamines is much higher than cocaine because amphetamines have clear withdrawal syndromes with medium to high doses, while cocaine has very acute withdrawal symptoms only after large extended use. Also, amphetamines have a higher psychological dependence potency, which is the primary reason amphetamines are given in very low doses.
8. Amphetamines are well-known for "producing" better mental performance. But, this has to be measured in two factors: speed of reaction and correctness of reaction. Amphetamines clearly speed reaction times, but also cause more wrong answers. Mostly, used in low doses, amphetamines are used to stay awake and prolong student study sessions.
