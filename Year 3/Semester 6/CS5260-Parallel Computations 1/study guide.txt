define parallel speedup  -- Sp=T1/Tp<=p  ----------T is time for these, Tp or T1 is Tsub1, Tsubp. Time of 1 process, Time of all processes
what is normally the mas speedup?
what is parallel efficiency?  -- Ep=Sp/p<=1
what is superlinear speedup?
Need to know how to use mpi calls and such---READ THE FUCKING BOOK
Give a formula for T. parallele time, Taking Overhead into account -- Tp=T1/p + To
What is a SPMD program?
Flynn's Taxonomy SISD, SIMD, MIMD? give examples of each
Fixed Topology Architectures
	Arrays where end points connect to endpoints on same area
	hypercube -- dimensions: d, # of nodes in d=2^d. d=0, n=1. d=1, n=2. d=2, n=4.
		each node is directly connected to d nodes
		longest distance between any node is d
Name the collective(General) communications(MPI)
	broadcast
	gather
	scatter
	reduce
