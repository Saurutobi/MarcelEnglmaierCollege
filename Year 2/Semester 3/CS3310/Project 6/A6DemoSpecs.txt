A6 Demo Specs

1) RE-Create a NEW version of the World DB in MySQL
   (using WorldDriver, after removing:  SOURCE ... InsertCityData.sql)
   so it's a FRESH NEW DB (since you've DELETEd/INSERTed/UPDATEd some
   of the data in the tables during your program testing).

2) run your PROGRAM using the WorldTrans.txt file
   which creates a LogFile.txt

3) hand in:
   the LogFile.txt (printed in smaller font & landscape, as needed so
        there's no/minimal wrap-around)
   your program code (which is in 3 physically separate files):
	UserProg, DataRetrieval class,  DataUpdate class


I do NOT need to see anything which you did manually or with my
SCRIPT (COMMAND) files in MySQL.  The LogFile will give me what I need
to know with all those SELECT statements.


AS STATED IN THE SPECS. . .
Make sure the LogFile contains for each transaction:
a. the original transaction file request data line,
b. the results from executing the “query”
	(which would be a 1-many-line “table” for a select,
	 or a reassurance message for an insert/delete/update),
c. a blank line

CAUTION:
 No hard-coding (like my Demo Program did) in your code of
   - SQL queries themselves
   - header-line column labels
     (Either DON'T USE ANY HEADINGS or get them from the DBS)
