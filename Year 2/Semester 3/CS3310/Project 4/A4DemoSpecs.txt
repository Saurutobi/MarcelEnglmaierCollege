For the DEMO,
1 - run TempSetupUtility program
2 - run TempUserApp program
3 - print out LogSession file
    (eliminate wrap-around by using landscape and/or
     a smaller font as needed)
4 - print out the 2 programs & the CodeIndex class


PACKET TO HAND IN - IN THIS ORDER:
1 – cover page
2 - LogSession
3 – 3 required code files
4 - any other code files you added


QUESTIONS?
1 – Does A4 need status messages?  NO
2 – How big should the arrays be (in CodeIndex) if static arrays
    are used for a node?
    MAX_M = 20 should suffice (a constant at the top
        of CodeIndex class which could easily be changed).
3 - How many nodes do I need room for in CodeIndex?  ONLY ONE
4 - What's the CodeIndex? file used in TempUserApp?  BINARY file(s)


CIRCLE THE FOLLOWING
1 – the internal BTree node storage in CodeIndex class
2 – the offset calculations for seeking
	in CodeIndex file
	in MainData file
3 – the 2 Seeks for CodeIndex & MainData files
4 – anything that you were NOT supposed to do,
    so I can more easily take off lots of points – like:
    - any explicit mention of 5 or 8 or 9 in your program
      (you’re supposed to use M or some function of M)
    - any linear searching of the CodeIndex file or MainData file
    - internal storage for the WHOLE code index
      or the WHOLE actual data storage
    - any reading of the CodeIndex file NOT done INSIDE ReadOneNode
      method (except for reading the header record in the constructor)
    - any 5-way or 8-way or 9-way if… else/if… else/if…  used in
      SearchOneNode
