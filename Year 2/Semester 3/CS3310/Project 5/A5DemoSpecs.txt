CS3310 - Kaminski - Asgn 5 demo specs


The DEMO:
[should not have to delete LogSession.txt file since
    SetupUtility opens it in TRUNCATE mode]
1) run SetupUtility which 
    - creates EuopeMapData.bin file
    - creates EuropeCityNames.txt file
    - pretty-prints both files to LogSession.txt file
2) use HexEdit to print out the MapData and CityNames files
3) run DrivingApp which processes CityPairs file

NOTES ON READABILITY:  

When printing LogSession.txt (in Word or WordPad...)
- use Courier New (or other fixed-width font) so that
  the pretty-printed Matrix comes out "nice" and aligned
- use landscape & a smallish font to avoid wrap-around for
  the Matrix (though wrap-around for the Path and TraceOfTargets
  is OK)
- useline wrap-around (vs. line-truncation) so the whole
  Path and TraceOfTargets is visible
- use small margins (like 0.5) to save paper.

Make sure that:

- the graph is implemented as an EXTERNAL Adjacency Matrix
  (NOT INTERNAL, for DrivingApp)
- the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm is the one that I
    discussed in class (and that's on the course webpage)
- you have the right answers (as far as you can tell):
	- check if they seem REASONABLE,
	- make sure there aren't duplicates in path or trace,
	- make sure trace's order of cities follows "what you
		know Dijkstra's Algorithm should do"
- the answer path:
    - prints from START to DESTINATION (not DESTINATION to START)
    - uses city NAMES. not city NUMBERS
- the trace of targets shows the cities in the order that they
    were selected as targets (Do NOT use Included array to print
    target nodes in alphabetical order).
- you follow the specs for the LogSession file format
