print cover sheet. sign it
print logsession in landscape mode so no text wrap
print dupMain.bin from a hexesit with hex&char versions
print all of the code files
print demospecs

delete all the above, print this:
Note:3c and 3d cannot be completed due to some sort of error, so 3c is not complete,
but 3d is accomplished by using the second record found in DupMainData.bin.
Appologies for the errors, this is just to prove I know the concepts of 3d.
