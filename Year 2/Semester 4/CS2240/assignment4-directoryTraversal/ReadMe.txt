Notes: i didn't do a typescript for this one because I don't have a directory tree to properly test it all.
	but, it compiled, and did the two things on the working directory that I chose

to compile, type "make"

to run: "./ass4 [x]"

the "[x]" refers to your inputs in this order: startDirectory Command file file etc...
	the Command is either "Find" or "RemoveCore", any others and the program won't work.
