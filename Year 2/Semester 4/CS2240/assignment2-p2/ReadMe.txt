Notes:
right off the bat, there is no float division algorithm. couldn't get it to work, cut it out.

I included a typescript incase your compiling fails.

to compile, type "make"

to run: "./ass2 [INT]"

the {INT} is the number of lines to read. the typescript includes: "./ass2 25" and "./ass2 239"

there are menu options: "f", "q", and "m". they must be entered as they are

the "f" is for find, to find, enter a valid code(i test with "DZA" and "RWA")
	they must be in capital letters to work
the "q" will quit
the "m" will give you more options

if your find returns nothing, it didn't find anything(obviously)

the query section will loop until you quit.
