Notes:
right off the bat, there is no float division algorithm. couldn't get it to work, cut it out.(same as
	assignment2, cost me 5 points);
Also, the Country code only outputs one letter(can't figure out why), and the float doesn't seem to
	work(same problem).

to compile, type "make"

to run: "./ass3 [INT]"

the {INT} is the number of lines to read.

I made a decent amount of changes from assignment2. I made the if statements much easier to read by using
	only 2 lines instead of curly brackets and 4. Also, my user interface loop from assignment2 was giving
	me issues, so I deleted it and made it do only one run.
