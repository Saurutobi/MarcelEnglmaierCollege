I wish to build a working prototype of a home automation application using
a Microsoft Surface Pro as a GUI, and at least one Arduino and Ethernet shield
to control the communication between program and Arduino. The GUI would be programmed
in Java, C#, or html. Communication to the Arduino would be through the Ethernet shield's
internet capabilities, and its communication to the Arduino. The Arduino works on a C-like
programming language. As a final project, this project is designed to create a modular
interface to allow for easy expansion into new platforms and easy additions to GUI for
future home and device additions. The final project will be able to allow for the switching on
and off of light switches, as well as timed settings such as turning on a coffee machine at 
6 am.
