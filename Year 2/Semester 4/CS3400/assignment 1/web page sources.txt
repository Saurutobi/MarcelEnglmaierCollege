it's wikipedia, but it's good because it contains examples of html and descriptions to reference

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/apis-php.html
this one had references of mysql extension stuff for php that we used
http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp
again w3schools, but this one is for php and is very helpful
